a Java desktop app to protect your laptop against potential thefts

This is a Java desktop app that can protect your laptop against potential thefts. Once you start the app, you can press enable which locks
out your computer. While the app is enabled, it will monitor the computer's power supply using a C script to check if the machine is
plugged in or not. If the machine gets unplugged, an alarm sounds and an email notification is sent. The alarm will only stop once the user
logs back in and disables the app. The alarm sound and the email can be updated in the app's settings.
